\f0\fs24 \cf0 I graduated from the Kiev Institute of Civil Aviation Engineers in 1984. I worked at many enterprises as a mechanical engineer and since 2016 I have been working in IT in the customer support service in various companies. Now I am studying programming and after training I hope to get a job in your company as a software developer in the Java language.\
My strengths include good learning and mathematical logic. To the weak - the inability to write long essays on literature. Since your work is related to programming where logic is required, I think that I can be useful as a software developer.}
