I graduated from the Kiev Institute of Civil Aviation Engineers in 1984.
I worked at many enterprises as a mechanical engineer and since 2016 I have been working in IT 
in the customer support service in various companies.
Now I am studying programming and after training I hope to get a job in your company as a software developer in the Java language.
My strengths include good learning and mathematical logic. 
To the weak - the inability to write long essays on literature. 
Since your work is related to programming where logic is required, I think that I can be useful as a software developer.
